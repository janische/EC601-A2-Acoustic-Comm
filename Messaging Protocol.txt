Questions:
        -Can we use chirp to take care of the timestamp on the message, or do we need to devote space within the message body for that?  Posixtime = 32 bit string, which would take half our space.




Structure:
        -Time (Posixtime): 4 bytes: half the message
        -Message: 2 bytes = 2^16 = 65536 possible messages
        -Sender id: 1 byte = 256 possible contacts
        -Receiver id: 1 byte = 256 possible contacts


Options for encoding the messages: 
        -bits 
                -example: “help” -> 00000000 00000001
        -ascii (for ease of programming)
                -example: “help” -> ‘a’




For the scope of this semester:
        Limit the messages to:
                -Help -> ‘1’
                -Head to surface -> ‘2’
                -Look at this fish! -> ‘3’
                -Shark -> ‘4’
        
Limit the contact list to:
                -JP -> ‘a’
                -Jonathan -> ‘b’
                -Glenn -> ‘c’
                -Amanda -> ‘d’
                -Unknown sender? -> ‘z’






Potential issues (mostly beyond the scope of this semester):
        -We’re not dealing with potential errors in transmission/decoding like most comm protocols
