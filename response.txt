I think you're confusing the sampling frequency with the audible 
frequencies used to encode the message.
16kHz refers to the protocol chirp is using, which means
the sampling frequency the devices is 16kHz.  The audible
frequency range used to code the message is 1.5kHz-7.8kHz.
So, your plots seem to verify that things are working correctly.
